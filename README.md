# Machine_Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without  being explicitly programmed.<br>

ML is divided into two categories:<br>
-Supervised <br>
-Unsupervised<br>

Supervised is where data is labelled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data<br>

This can be broken into: <br>
-Regression: problems here include prediction of a continous valued output e.g housing prices in Nairobi. <br>
-Classification: problems here deal with prediction of discrete number of values e.g is a particlar email spam or not <br>

Unsupervised Learning is where the program learns the inherent structure of the data based on unlabeled examples.<br>

Clustering is a common unsupervised machine learning approach that finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters. e.g Search engines to group similar objects in one cluster <br>
